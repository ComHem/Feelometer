# Feel-o-meter

> This is a small project we, Björn Lundkvist, Anna Aretakis and Jonna Kollin, did as a part of the "Talangprogram 2017".
> 
>  It's an application based on a concept the Agile Coach Johanna Särnå introduced to the Web Team where you can put a number on how you feel today. 
   This makes your colleagues understand how you feel. We took the application a bit further and added statistics so 
   you can follow up your own feels, your teams feels and your own team prior to other teams. 
>  
>  We figured that this can be fun but also helpfull to Agile Coaches and other stakeholders for example. 
>  
>  The application is a Spring Boot application with a MySQL database and the frontend is written in Vue.js.
